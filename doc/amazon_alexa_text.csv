5,Perfect,"I love everything about this washer. At first I was sceptical, but it turned out to be one of the best purchases I've made.<br /><br />Edit: couple months later...absolutely beyond pleased with this washer. In an apartment with 6 kids, it has saved my life. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who has a small space. Also want to add that if you use the ""child lock"" feature, you can add soaps or vinegar or whatever you want during the cycle without interrupting the program. Also, came with everything I needed to properly install, but I added a hose clamp for the drain hose just to be extra sure. LOVE the quick release feature on the hookup, and make sure the lid is closed to turn on. Very safe for children as the washer will stop completely if the lid is up, just make sure you use the ""child lock"" feature every time, or opening the lid will cause deletion of the program and the whole thing will have to be restarted. Love love üíï this washer. Wish I had bought one sooner.",2022-08-16 14:56:16.169,28,True

5,Economical solution to a problem that seemed more serious than it actually was,"Our dishwasher was not emptying completely at the end of a cycle, with a strong smell of overheated insulation filling the house. I traced the issue to the old pump stalling on the final high-temp rinse cycle. The internal temperature cutoff in the pump prevented a fire from the overheated coils, but got hot enough to generate an awful burning insulation smell throughout the house. This pump was a great and economical replacement. It has the identical yellow impeller as the old pump. It took me 30 seconds to install, as the pump twist-locks into the pump housing, accessible with the lower trim panel removed. This fixed the issue completely.",2017-06-02 13:34:25.000,4,True

So far everything is working properly clothes are being washed beautifully, the spinner is a absolutely fantastic you literally need to touch the clothes to your face to feel if they are wet. The fully automatic washer where I live doesn't spin the water out of your clothes this well. I hang my clothes on hangers or on my drying rack and they dry very quickly.

5,Newbie to Induction,"I have a glass top electric range in my condo in Florida, and my husband and I HATE it!  I've been curious about induction, but I didn't want to spend $1,000 or more on a cooktop without having experience induction first hand, so we bought the Max Burton 6200 burner - the one that comes with the element that allows you to use non-magnetic pans, because replacing virtually ALL my cookware could add considerably to the overall cost of conversion to induction.  I was able to find a couple of very reasonably priced well-made magnetic pans to get me started.<br /><br />I've used it for about a month now - as much as I can.  Initially I used it to determine if I liked it.  NOW I use it as often as I can because I LOVE it!<br /><br />Other reviews I've read complained that the low settings didn't work well; I have NOT experienced that at all. Heat control is instantaneous.  When you turn it on with a pan on the burner, it defaults to heat Level 5.  Olive oil starts to shimmer within seconds, but when you lower the heat setting, the change is instantaneous.  One thing I have noticed is the cooking time for dishes I make frequently, is MUCH quicker - I haven't timed it scientifically, but I'd estimate cooking time is cut between 1/3 and 1/2.  I now prep ALL my ingredients in advance; I don't have time to chop the next ingredient while the first are cooking.  And, I can't leave it unattended (probably because I used gas for my first 40 years of cooking and have only a month's experience using Induction).<br /><br />I was NOT impressed with the Induction Interface Disk that was bundled with the burner we bought.  I tried it twice and was not at all impressed with the performance of my non-magnetic pans.  You will not experience true induction cooking with this device.  If I had judged my satisfaction using the disk, I would have a totally negative review instead of a glowing review.<br /><br />I'm SOLD on induction; TOTALLY in love with this method of cooking.  I don't hesitate to recommend buying the Max Burton 6200 as an extra burner or to try induction before investing in a new cooktop or range.",2013-08-18 16:20:59.000,0,False

Back in the 70's gold must have been a popular color for appliances in a kitchen. I personally only like white for kitchen appliances, but when we moved in all the appliances were still working so I couldn't justify replacing them due to the fact I didn't like the color. One by one they finally started to fail and each time they were replaced with white.<br /><br />When it came time to replace the range we had serious trouble trying to find one to fit in the space we had. We finally found one and only one to fit the space. But the range hoods that went with the brand of the range were expensive yet looked awful! We were very happy to find this range hood.

5,Fits Moccamaster CD Grand Coffeemaker,"We purchased the Moccamaster CD Grand many years ago when it first came out. The original coffee makers which use regular sized coffee filters, made much too small a pot of coffee. Europeans apparently drink smaller quantities of coffee than Americans do. At that time it was very difficult to find the Moccamaster Grand filters needed for this pot. Also at that time they did not make a large enough basket filter to substitute for the paper filters. Also the moccamaster paper filters were expensive and came in very small quantities when you could even find them.<br /><br />I decided to try the Bunn 12 cup commercial filters which were comparatively inexpensive, well made and could be purchased in much larger quantities. I am pleased to say they worked perfectly. I bought 2 packs of 1000, which lasted for about 5 years, making a pot of coffee every day and occasionally a second pot of coffee. We tried a gold tone type basket made to accommodate commercial size pots but they didn't work as well as the smaller gold tone brand name baskets. We are very happy with these filters and recently repurchased to replenish our supply and appreciate the great price we are able to buy them for on Amazon, and that Amazon continues to offer this high quality product. Highly recommend.",2021-05-08 15:25:59.052,7,True

If you have the time and energy, this is just right for you. I used it happily for a long time when it was just me and 2 little kids. The spinner WILL break if you overload it, by the way. I broke it. Customer service tried to help, but it was not fixable. Once I became a family of four doing a lot of laundry, this machine was not up to the task anymore. This machine is just too much labor. Entire days were consumed doing laundry and by the time we were done, we were too tired to do anything else that was fun.",2017-07-02 17:59:56.395,1,True
4,Good Overall!,"My opinion may improve as I learn to use the product a little better. Right now though, I would give it 3.5-4 stars as I have had somewhat mixed success using this. Basically, sometimes my coffee is coming out a bit too watered down.<br /><br />There are a few things which could be causing this:<br />1. Not enough coffee. I have pretty much ruled this one out though as I have successfully made cups of coffee using the same amount of grinds.<br />2. Too coarse a grind. This ultimately may be the culprit. I am going to experiment this week with a finer grind (I grind my coffee at the store when I buy it and am just now running out of my initial purchase).<br />3. Too much water too fast. I've noticed if you pour in too much water too quickly, some of the water seems to run more or less straight through the filter. I do not have this problem with my Chemix, but I am learning.<br /><br />In summary, I will probably like this filter more in the future as I learn how to use it better. For those who have had great success straight out of the gate, good for you! I was NOT given one of these units to review as many of the other reviewers were. Just know you might have to experiment a little to get the coffee exactly how you like it. I don't really mind!",2015-10-24 20:26:13.000,0,True

4,An Improvement on OEM,"Tired of the constant lint from the Kenmore clothes dryer, I took a couple of remedial measures, one of which was to replace the ineffective 12-year-old OEM lint filter.  The old one had a heavy felt gasket around it - so thick it often seemed to cause gaps, rather than prevent them. The felt on this one is less pronounced but seems to provide a tighter seal, forcing the expelled air through the filter rather than around it.  Result: it catches more lint.<br /><br />Overall though, let's cry shame on the manufacturers of electric dryers, none of which seem to be able to make a filter that truly catches even 50% of the lint.  A special problem if your dryer for some reason has to be vented indoors (mine does); but still bad even if you're just pushing all that lint outdoors to flutter around and goop up the air.",2019-12-23 12:13:13.732,1,True

It's a solid unit so, you can leave it loose inside the pipe for easy removal and reinserting for cleaning so that's nice.

It is as if they encased the freezer with plastic and then just put the freezer together afterward including the logo, the dials and the hinges. So if you try to take off the plastic, its almost impossible to take it off from those areas, therefore it is a huge eyesore since there is a ton of plastic still hanging in the cracks and its extremely time consuming and difficult to take it all off.",2023-04-03 17:28:18.732,0,True

Amazon made a price adjustment that we could live with and I give Amazon credit for responsive customer service.<br /><br />The temperature control is located behind the freezer which is not convenient so you have to move the whole unit to adjust. The shelves are not adjustable because they are integrated with the cooling coils.

4,Efficient and Economical -- PRE CHILL your water with my tip!,"I've had this ice maker for about 18 months.  I keep a 20 lb Rubbermaid Container on my freezer shelf, and that holds all of my ice for the month.  So, every 2 weeks or so, when I'm housecleaning and organizing, I have ""ice day.""  That day, I'll run this machine all morning and fill up the 20 lb container in the freezer, and then shut the machine off until next time.<br /><br />Pros:  Easy to use, still plugging away 1.5 years later after 2x monthly use, and not expensive.  Makes 20 lbs of ice fairly quickly over the course of the morning. I get 9 cubes every other minute or so (and see my tip for speeding up the process).  9 cubes sounds like it would take a long time to make a huge batch, but surprisingly, I've filled my bucket in just a few hours, while I'm doing other chores.<br /><br />Tip 1:  The first few batches of ice, in an Ice Day Session, are thin, brittle, and weak.  Not much use to me.  I don't bother putting the ice basket in, at the outset of my Ice Day.  Instead, I let the first 2-3 batches of ice fall right back down into the water chamber.  This has the effect of giving the ice making rods more time to get super cold and make thicker, solid and dense cubes, instead of the weak and breakable batch.<br /><br />Tip 2:  MORE IMPORTANTLY, by letting the first 2-3 batches of ice fall back into the water super chills that water, and it runs through the system and makes the ice much more quickly.  Of course, if you have ice in your freezer you can just add it to your water chamber, but the first few batches are not worth keeping anyway, so let them drop into the water, super chill your ice water, and put the basket in the chamber for Batch 4 and higher.<br /><br />Con 1:  It's surprising heavy by itself, no water.  If you plan to leave it out and use it often, find a dedicated spot near the sink so you're not lifting it as I was. I finally bought a little Ikea cart and put in that, so I can roll it up to my sink on Ice Days.<br /><br />Con 2:  Very short cord.  I bought a mini-length appliance extension cord (it's about 18 inches long and heavy duty) and that lets me run this (and my Instant Pot), from a cart, up to the wall outlet.<br /><br />Con 3:  I had no idea I'd get so much grime inside.  You think ""it's just running water, right? How can it get dirty?"" And yet it does.  I have to use one of those foam magic erasers, pretty much every time I use it, on the inside water chamber, and especially on the ice basket. There will be a thin layer of black spots in the crevices, from moisture mildew I suppose. I've never tasted it in my ice, but now that I know, I'm careful to clean it 2x monthly before  use it, and make sure you drain away all water when turning it off, to prevent this build up of mildew.",2019-11-01 18:43:31.845,0,False

3,Search for Cheat to Espresso Continues...,"I agree for the most part with many other comments/reviews here, especially T. Harris. I am rating on the lower side because i am one of those silly crema obsessed espresso fanatics who keep wasting money on gimmicks claiming to make espresso when by now I could have purchased a prosumer machine that actually does satisfy my craving. I have found myself ridiculously straining to squeeze that wonderful crema from the grounds in my aeropress with the fellow adaptor only to be disappointed with a grittier cup of good coffee that honestly didn't taste as good as when i used the paper filter. Once or twice now I have gotten excited as i saw what looked like crema in the cup, but it fizzled out to a little tan ring around the edge. I'm disappointed because the pictures and the wording DO make claims of making something like espresso with crema. Yes I know we nutty folks get a bit obsessed with that word ""crema"" but it isn't just an aesthetic element to espresso, it is evidence of having drawn out the oils of the bean in an amazing way capturing what we love of the smell of coffee and making it tangible and drinkable adding entirely unique aromas, flavor and texture. So, to be sold once again (dummy me) by the claim of espresso, makes it seem a less valuable product. the claim is even that the ""pressure-actuated"" component assists in making this like espresso and this is entirely false. Its only function (and on a positive note this function does make the product a bit more valuable) is to prevent the loss of water into cup before finished stirring/brewing. As soon as even the lightest pressure is applied, the valve opens and the real resistance is created by the grounds and the screen. I will say however that my interest in the aeropress has been renewed realizing after stashing it away for so long in the search of other possible cheats to achieve espresso, that it makes a pretty darn good cup of coffee and until i can afford or am ready to admit my obsession completely enough to buy a real espresso machine i should just chill out on the espresso hunt and enjoy good coffee. so today i ordered two regular screen filters for 7 bucks (so atleast i won't pull any muscles trying to get the fellow attachment on and off or smash a cup trying to put 700 lbs of pressure onto my aeropress....although maybe...just maybe...  :-).",2019-10-10 23:13:31.665,5,True

3,Just a comment,"We live in Europe and the US. While we have had Bosch appliances at times, we've moved on.<br /><br />Americans should understand Bosch appliances are the GE or Whirlpool of Europe. They are not good, not bad but little more than mass market appliances built to a price point. The premium price charged in the USA is supporting the marketing that goes into posturing the brand as some sort of upscale product.  There are many European brands that are mass market in Europe but advertise and charge luxury market prices in the US. Sort of funny for us but be aware that this marketing strategy is used by many of the German companies.<br /><br />In a nutshell, our experience: Bosch dishwasher are junk (poor space utilization and noisy, very similar to US brands but more expensive) refrigerators work fine but certainly not commensurate with the price in the US and the stoves/ranges are quite good in operation but, based on our friends' reports, not particularly reliable.",2011-06-06 13:58:02.000,10,False

So, you have to pull the freezer drawer out all the way each time you want a few cubes.<br />- The freezer drawer is hard to pull out and push in when full (it is always full)<br />- There is a very low level high pitched whine all the time.<br />- The filtered ice water is inside and runs very slow.  This may be a problem with the installation not allowing enough water through, but you the door is kept open the entire time you are filling a glass.  So, we never use it.<br />- The warning sound if a door is left ajar is barely audible.<br />- Worried about the reports of flimsy drawers breaking and other mechanical failures.<br /><br />Bottom line, we should have searched more carefully when making this investment.

While not necessarily a direct measure of water quality, the finding makes me question if this is doing anything other than slightly improving the taste of the water.

We got this so we could put the new ones in the top, and the oldest would be available in the front.<br />but it doesn't work like that. There is non way to put the eggs in the back and they dont rolls from top to bottom, its 2 separate areas. so you have to just put them in from the front, kind of pointless ""scrolling"".<br />and the angle isn't enough to make the eggs roll a lot of times. so you need to wiggle it to make them roll forward.

2,going back to a brita,"i've purchased this filter 3 times now.  once I had to send it back for a replacement because the water was all murky (after purging it for like 3 gallons) and didn't taste right (smelled like fish also).  The other two worked, but they lasted about 5 weeks before the water flow becomes painfully slow.  I think this is mainly because the water in my area must be bad, as they should last much longer.  I decided i'm not going to continue to spend $40 for 5 weeks of water.  The brita takes up space in the fridge but the ability to get a glass of water quickly is more important to me than others, maybe.  I'm considering just paying for a water bottle service as it would also probably be much cheaper than paying for these filters every 5 weeks.

2,Will mess up your clothes,"There is a lot that goes into a washer/dryer like this.  I'll say what I like first... large capacity, spin cycle remove lots of excess water which reduces dry time, dries quickly (at least for now while it's new), no buzzer on dry cycle (if you like that).<br /><br />Here's the problems I found: the day after I bought the first one it broke down. The second one was installed and sure enough there are issues.  The washer makes more gulping and clicking sounds than any other new washer I've owned.  The dryer has sharp plastic edges that could destroy your laundry and create snags. I compared it to my friend's dryer and this is completely a flaw and inferior design!  Also, there is in fact a large horizontal gap on the underside of the lint holder.  I haven't washed any button downs but I can definitely see how buttons can get stuck in that gap as other reviews have stated.  Overall too many problems.  I bought this due to the exact sizing I needed but if I were to do it again I would get a different unit.",2014-02-24 23:51:07.000,8,False

It‚Äôs like you can‚Äôt wind up the knob all the way. So it‚Äôs not in working condition after a year. And this thing isn‚Äôt cheap! When I take the leap to buy a new one soon I‚Äôm getting one with digital screen m, it just doesn‚Äôt have a spinner.

2,Part # alone is not enough!,"PSA - make sure you take your old element out and compare it carefully to the pictures. I very meticulously researched the right part # for my old GE JBS26 oven and bought this - however, assuming I was sent exactly what I ordered - it was not compatible. You'd think the exact part # would be the exact replacement part - I mean duh, right? But no. Screw holes are very tiny, pin holes, really. Much smaller than the original and no screws are included. There was simply no way to screw the wires to the element.<br /><br />After much cursing and trying to figure out what to do, I was too impatient to return the thing and start over. I drilled out the tiny screw holes a bit by forcibly screwing the pointy original screws in as much as possible, then rummaged around for some smaller screws - managed to connect the wires securely. Then went to slide it into position - another fantastic surprise! The screw holes for the baffle or whatever it's called were not even close! More cursing. So I got a big sheet of tin foil and folded it a bunch of times to create a makeshift baffle, folded it around the element and covered the opening, and let it sit there w/o being screwed in. Turned the breaker back on, turned the oven on and watched it like a hawk. It worked. No fire started. The install is actually better/safer than the 25 year old corroded parts it replaced without being very much different. But still, I was a bit nervous given the makeshift nature of the install.<br /><br />Then threw in a pizza and the temperature was all over the place - too hot, then too cold. Maybe I'll get a feel for it and be able to adjust - the old one was always 15-20 degrees hotter than the dial said but was consistent so could be adjusted for. This one seems to run a bit cooler than the dial but did get fully heated up to over 400 degrees. Maybe there's a break in period with these elements, who knows.<br /><br />Overall, I spent the better part of an evening struggling to do something that should have taken 10 minutes. But I do have a working oven again. Next time a similar situation arises,  I'll probably spend more for a genuine OEM name brand part. Remember, verify visually - apparently an exact match for the part number is not enough! For some stupid reason.",2020-07-16 17:01:04.422,0,True

It became unresponsive while it was still on!!! I had to reset the unit by flipping the breaker off/on. The user guide has no troubleshooting for if the unit touch screen buttons do not respond.
